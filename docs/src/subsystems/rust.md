# Rust subsystem

This section documents the Rust subsystem.

## Translators

### cargo-lock (pure)

Translates a `Cargo.lock` file to a dream2nix lockfile.

### cargo-toml (impure)

Translates a `Cargo.toml` file to a dream2nix lockfile by generating a
`Cargo.lock` file first and then using `cargo-lock` translator on the
generated lockfile.

## Builders

### build-rust-package (pure) (default)

Builds a package using `buildRustPackage` from `nixpkgs`.

### crane (ifd)

Builds a package using [`crane`](https://github.com/ipetkov/crane).

#### Override gotchas

This builder builds two separate derivations, one for your crate's dependencies
and another for your crate. This means that if you want to override stuff for
the dependencies, you need to use the `<crate-name>-deps` key for your override
where `<crate-name>` is the name of the crate you are building.

```nix
{
  # ...
  packageOverrides = {
    # this will apply to your crate
    crate.my-overrides = { /* ... */ };
    # this will apply to your crate's dependencies
    crate-deps.my-overrides = { /* ... */ };
  };
  # ...
}
```

#### On the IFD marking

The `crane` builder utilizes IFD to clean the source your crates reside in.
This is needed to not rebuild the dependency only derivation everytime the
source for your crates is changed.

However this does not mean that the IFD will always be triggered. If you
are passing dream2nix a path source or a flake source, then IFD won't be
triggered as these sources are already realized. But if you are passing
the result of a `pkgs.fetchFromGitHub` for example, this will trigger IFD
since it is not already realized.

### Specifying the Rust toolchain

Specify an override for all packages that override the Rust toolchain used.
This can be done like so:

```nix
{
  # ...
  packageOverrides = {
    # ...
    "^.*".set-toolchain.overrideRustToolchain = old: {
      inherit (pkgs) cargo rustc;
    };
    # ...
  };
  # ...
}
```

You can also of course override the toolchain for only certain crates:

```nix
{
  # ...
  packageOverrides = {
    # ...
    crate-name.set-toolchain.overrideRustToolchain = old: {
      inherit (pkgs) cargo rustc;
    };
    # ...
  };
  # ...
}
```

#### crane notes

The crane builder does not require a `rustc` package in the toolchain specified,
only a `cargo` package is needed. If cross-compiling, keep in mind that it also
takes `cargo` packages like so:

```nix
{
  cargoHostTarget = cargo-package;
  cargoBuildBuild = other-cargo-package;
}
```

where `cargoHostTarget` has the same meaning as coming from a `pkgsHostTarget`
and `cargoBuildBuild` has the same meaning as coming from a `pkgsBuildBuild`.
